## About Ascend Partners

Ascend Partners is a strategy and transformation firm that helps executive teams navigate deep shifts in technology, geopolitics and industry. We work with leaders to build **durable performance trajectories** by making their organizations more **sovereign**, more **resilient**, and more **competitive**.

Our approach is:

- **Human-centric** – transformation only succeeds when it is embodied by committed leaders and engaged managers.
- **AI-augmented** – artificial intelligence is treated not as a side IT project, but as a strategic and human pivot.
- **Execution-driven** – we stay involved “from the first to the last mile”, turning vision into concrete, paced delivery.

## What We Do

We support organizations along three main axes:

### 1. Acceleration of Change

We help executives succeed in complex transformations by connecting **strategy, organization, culture and human dynamics**. Our role is to:

- Clarify direction and priorities  
- Remove blockers and reduce friction  
- Sustain the right execution speed over time  

### 2. Technologisation of Models (AI & Data)

AI reshapes productivity and business models. We help executive committees:

- Build a **shared narrative** around AI  
- Set up **clear governance** and roles  
- Anchor **virtuous human–AI collaboration** inside teams  

The objective: make technology a **durable engine of action**, aligned with the company’s culture and métiers.

### 3. Industrial Repositioning & Sovereignty

Facing geopolitical tensions and technological disruptions, we support companies in:

- Reorienting towards **future-proof industrial value chains**  
- Building **more robust supply chains**  
- Helping SMEs and mid-caps diversify and move upmarket  

We turn constraints into **growth opportunities** and strengthen **European industrial sovereignty**.

## The Indice de Résilience Numérique (IRN)

Ascend Partners CEO **David Djaïz**, co-initiated the **Indice de Résilience Numérique (IRN)** with Yann Lechelle (ex-CEO of Scaleway) and the **Digital New Deal Foundation**.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

IRN is a collaborative framework and tool designed to help organizations **measure their critical technological dependencies** and build **sovereign action plans**. It serves as a 360° resilience instrument across IT, data and AI, from infrastructure to critical business applications.

IRN is structured around **three complementary axes**:

1. **Critical Business Applications**  
   - Map critical processes and the applications that support them  
   - Assess vulnerabilities (single providers, lack of alternatives, etc.)  
   - Identify levers to progressively increase resilience  

2. **Global Technical Criteria**  
   - Share of tech spend with EU / French suppliers  
   - Data location and legal sovereignty  
   - Degree of openness (open source, open standards)  
   - Diversification strategies (multi-cloud, multi-supplier)  
   - Continuity capabilities in case of failure of a critical provider  

3. **Culture, Organisation & Governance**  
   - Involvement of top leadership (Comex, Board)  
   - Awareness of digital risk and asset criticality  
   - Alignment with regulatory frameworks (RGPD, DORA, AI Act, NIS2, etc.)  
   - Readiness for disruption and “digital crash” scenarios  

The output combines a **radar (spider) chart** with a **detailed report**, giving leaders an immediate, visual profile of their digital resilience and the ability to **“choose their battles”**.

Our long-term ambition is for IRN to become a **European open standard**, freely usable by organizations wishing to objectify and master their digital dependencies.
